            <h1>Automatically Hosting Compiled LaTeX Documents Using GitHub Pages</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="article-content">
            <p>As a student, I often share my summaries and solutions to exams with my classmates. This year, when creating a collaborative repository, I realized that I needed to host the compiled LaTeX PDFs elsewhere to avoid merge conflicts. However, I also wanted to keep it easily accessible for less tech-savvy classmates who may not be familiar with LaTeX. The solution? Hosting the compiled PDF on GitHub Pages.</p>

						<p><a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> is a free service that allows you to host static files, making it perfect for this purpose. In this article, I will walk you through the process of automatically hosting your compiled LaTeX documents on GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions.</p>

            <h2>Setting Up GitHub Pages</h2>
            <p>First, I enabled GitHub Pages for my repository by creating a special branch called <code>gh-pages</code>. This branch will hold the compiled PDFs and any other assets I want to make available through the Pages service.</p>

            <h2>Setting Up the GitHub Actions Workflow</h2>
            <p>Next, I created a GitHub Actions workflow to automatically compile the LaTeX document whenever changes are pushed to the <code>main</code> branch of the repository. The workflow also ensures that the compiled PDF is deployed to the <code>gh-pages</code> branch. Here's how the workflow looks:</p>

            <div class="code-fragment">
                <pre><code class="language-yaml">
name: Build and Deploy LaTeX Document

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    permissions:
      contents: write
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # Checkout the repository
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Compile the LaTeX document
      - name: Compile LaTeX document
        uses: xu-cheng/latex-action@v3
        with:
          root_file: main.tex
          work_in_root_file_dir: true

      # Checkout gh-pages branch
      - name: Checkout gh-pages branch
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          ref: gh-pages
          path: gh-pages

      # Copy the compiled PDF to the gh-pages branch
      - name: Copy compiled PDF to gh-pages
        run: |
          cp main.pdf gh-pages/
          
      # Remove the PDF from the main branch
      - name: Remove main.pdf from main branch
        run: |
          rm main.pdf

      # Commit and push the changes to gh-pages
      - name: Commit and push PDF to gh-pages
        run: |
          cd gh-pages
          git config user.name "github-actions"
          git config user.email "github-actions@github.com"
          git add -f main.pdf
          git commit -m "Deploy compiled PDF"
          git push
                </code></pre>
            </div>

            <p>With this workflow in place, every time I push changes to the main branch, the LaTeX document is automatically compiled, and the resulting PDF is pushed to the <code>gh-pages</code> branch for hosting.</p>

            <h2>Accessing the Compiled PDF</h2>
						<p>Once the compiled PDF is hosted on GitHub Pages, you can access it directly from the URL of the repository's Pages site by it's path. However, you could also a provide an <code>index.html</code> that redirects the <code>/</code> path to the file you want to host. I did something like</p>

						<div class="code-fragment">
							<pre><code class="language-html">
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;
    &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Redirect&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; url=https://path/to/file.pdf"&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Redirecting to PDF. If you are not redirected immediately, click &lt;a href="https://path/to/file.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
						</code></pre>

						<p>I hope you found this information helpful! As a student, I highly encourage you to share your knowledge and solutions with others, while always respecting intellectual property. Collaborative learning fosters growth and enhances understanding, and it's worth noting that providing detailed solutions for each problem is no small task for teachers. If you spot any mistakes or have suggestions for improvement, please feel free to reach out—I’d love to hear from you!</p>
